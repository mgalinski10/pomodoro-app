Pomodoro counter  [LINK TO SITE](https://66c068f950dbc62fd81e1d69--delicate-marigold-d2faf4.netlify.app/)

In this project I made a Pomodoro Timer, which helps me to be be focused while I'm coding. First, I did all HTML and CSS. For design and style, I used SCSS. I belive that code is easier to read in this way. Second step was a timer. It have one mode -> 25min focus and 5 min rest. By use "Finish button" You can stop the timer, and reset it. Timer works, thanks to recursion. 

Overall, I belive my timer has nice and simple design and works properly.
